# PHP CLI Development Introduction

If you are not familiar with CLI, then this is the perfect introduction for you. In this tutorial, I will go over how to write command-line-driven PHP where you can hit an external API and parse results by simply typing a single command in your terminal. With CLI, you can give other non-developers a way to run your code with flags and variables that will be contained within 1 line in either CMD, Powershell, Terminal, or other command-line interfaces.

This tutorial is not in-depth by any means but should help you get started with exploring CLI and PHP development.

Code we will run in CLI:
php index.php {postID or NULL} {-c or NULL} {true or null|false}
